Dr. Kedar S. Sathaye did his first degree in Physics from his hometown university, University of Pune. He did additional year of Bachlor's degree studies from the same university to receive his Bachelor's in Electronics. After completing the Bachelor's degree he continued his higher studies abroad from England. There he did Masters in Physics of Laser Communications from University of Essex. Thereafter he returned to India to begin the research in the field of optical waveguides and their applications in sensors. For 1 year he continued working on the same subject. In March 2008 he went to do further studies by doing the doctorate degree from Telecom Bretagne. The subject of his PhD was structuring of liquid crystals to build different optical technologies. During his PhD he has become well versed with clean room environment. He possese thorough knowledge of different liquid crystal phases like ferroelectric, nematic and cholesteric. He is capable of devising different liquid crystal related experiments and characterisation of same. He has adequate knowledge of alignment technologies, use of different reactive mesogens for various applications, use of cholesteric liquid crystals for fabrication of filters, Fabry-Perot, tunable cavities, switchable mirrors. He has a working knowledge of electro-optic measurements, decent knowledge of optical thin film technologies and birefrigent films. After completing his PhD he has continued his research in the same department in the field of cholesteric liquid crystals (Texto informado pelo autor)
