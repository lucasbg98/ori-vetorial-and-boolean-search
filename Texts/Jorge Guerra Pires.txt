I have concluded my bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering (Engenharia de Produção), granted by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto). My main focus was optimization, mainly mathematical-computational models. (2005-2009). I have attended my master degree in science on the framework of the double diploma programme between Italy (University of L'Aquila) and Poland (Gdansk University of Technolofy). I have focused on Systems Biology and Computational Intelligence. However, I have studied, as part of the agreement done between the coordinates and the students, theoretical mathematics in Italy and computational physics in Poland. ..............2005-2009 Industrial Engineering (Bachelor).
