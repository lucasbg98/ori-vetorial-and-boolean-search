The author undergraduated in Mechanical Engineer in Universidade Federal Fluminense, in Brazil, in 2007. During this time, the author focusing in the heat transfer and fluid mechanics sciences for turbulent low Reynolds number flows. In 2008, the author initiates his Master Science degree studies in the Aeronautical Institute of Technology, Brazil. The author studies focusing on evaluate the transonic turbulent flow effects on the aeroelastic stability analysis using state space variables. The Master thesis was approved in December, 2010. In January, 2010, the author was hired as Product Development Engineer by General Motors Corporation, GMB, in Brazil. In GMB, he works in the subsystem validation and virtual analysis and simulation teams. As subsystem validation engineer, the author was responsible for injected parts. His activities include quality tools approval, design and product requirements validation and specification of in-house and supplier validation tests. In the virtual analysis and simulation team, the author responsibility focuses to perform the design validation tests in a CAE ambient for new vehicles. Since 2011, the author left GMB and went work to EMBRAER in the Aeroelastic team as Research and Development Product Engineer. The author s responsibilities in EMBRAER focus on developing and improving the current aeroelastic process and support in aeroelastic modeling and analyses for new and current projects.
