Dr. Hughes has over 30 years of experience in sampling and analyzing data for fish assemblages in various parts of the United States. He has used his expertise to develop and evaluate indicators for the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), to evaluate ecoregions, and to generate biological criteria. He also has extensive experience in sampling and analyzing data of benthos, sedimentary diatom, zooplankton, and periphyton assemblages. His experience includes sampling in small streams and ponds, as well as the Great Lakes and large navigable rivers. Dr. Hughes was a key member of the research team that developed and field-tested the ecoregion concept that led to the map of the ecoregions of the United States. He co-chaired the National Workshop on Instream Biological Monitoring and Criteria in 1987, co-authored EPA's Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Fish and Benthic Macroinvertebrates in 1989, and provided technical expertise to the EPA's Steering Committee on Biological Criteria 1988-1990. Dr. Hughes edited three AFS books in 2005-2006, and has authored over 100 peer reviewed publications. He has received 6 EPA awards for best scientific paper or technical contribution, was awarded the best paper in Transactions of the American Fisheries Society in 2008, has been a guest speaker eight times each in Europe and South America, and was awarded the 2006 Environmental Stewardship Award by the North American Benthological Society.
