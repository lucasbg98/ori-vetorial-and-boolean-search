I hold a bachelor degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics (2010) and master degree in Applied Mathematics (2013), both by the University of Campinas, Brazil. During my masters I worked in the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), as a trainee researcher. I have expertise in modelling agricultural systems and its greenhouse gases emissions, linear and non-linear programming. Currently I am PhD student in Optimization and Operational Research at The University of Edinburgh. The PhD is focused on the modelling of sustainable intensification of beef production systems in Brazil. (Texto informado pelo autor)
