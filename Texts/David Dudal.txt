I have a PhD in Physics from Ghent University (2005). I can present ample research and teaching experience in Physics, focusing on General Theory of Particles and Fields. I have worked at Ghent University as a Postdoctoral Researcher since 2005, my research being funded by the Special Research Fund (UGent) and the Research-Foundation Flanders. From July-December 2008, I spent a research period at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA). Since 2002, I have been collaborating intensively with the group (members) of prof. Silvio Paolo Sorella (UERJ), leading to numerous publications in first class physics journals. I frequently visit the UERJ, more precisely I've been there during the following periods: 12 Nov 2011 3 Dec 2011, 05-23 Nov 2010, 04-21 Jan 2010,19-31 Jul 2009,18 Oct 09 Nov 2007,17 Nov 08 Dec 2006,7-26 Jan 2006,23 Apr-13 May 2005,10-29 Aug 2004,6 Feb-7 Mar 2004,23 May-13 Jun 2003. I also had the opportunity to welcome profs. Rodrigo Ferreira Sobreiro (now at UFF, Nitéroi) twice and Marcelo Santos Guimaraes (UERJ) for a few weeks at Ghent University to collaborate on ongoing projects. More recently, I have also collaborated with profs. Attilio Cucchieri and Tereza Mendes (USP, São Carlos). From February 2011-August 2011, Attilio Cucchieri worked at the UGent after we succesfully applied for a grant with the Special Research Fund (UGent). I have a basic understanding of Portuguese, as I took a 1-year course in Gent (Belgium). (Texto informado pelo autor)
