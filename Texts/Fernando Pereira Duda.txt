My research interest lies in the field of continuum thermodynamics covering the subject as a whole, with emphasis on aspects related to its application as a framework for the description of multiscale and multiphysics phenomena. I have been working in continuum mechanics since obtaining my graduate degree. My first studies centered on theoretically related problems in finite strain kinematics and non-linear elasticity. Around 2000, I became interested in problems related to the inelastic behavior of solids for situations not described by classical continuum theories. Then, following the framework of modern continuum mechanics, as developed by Fried, Gurtin and others, I considered the formulation of finite strain continuum theories for: inelastic behavior due to rearrangements on the micro-scale; elastic brittle behavior. The formulation relied on the introduction of a microstructural field along with the corresponding force system, as well as on a thermodynamically consistent constitutive theory encompassing: i) the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into its elastic and inelastic parts, the latter related to a microstructural field via a constraint (only for the first case); ii) condition under which microstructural changes commence (loading condition). These theories can account for both rate and gradient effects, whereby accommodating weakly-nonlocal theories for plasticity with and without an elastic range, viscoplasticity, brittle and fatigue damage. I also conducted some work on the application of a version of the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for the numerical treatment of configurational force- based continuum theories for interface and crack propagation. Recently, my research activities have been carried out in the context of Hydrogen Assisted Cracking (HAC), Bulk Nanostructured Materials and Turbulence Modeling. (Texto informado pelo autor)
