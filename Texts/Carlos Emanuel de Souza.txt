Carlos E. de Souza received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil, in 1976 and the doctoral degree from the University of Paris VI, France, in 1980. From 1980-1984 he was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil. In 1985 he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Australia and worked there till 1997. Since 1998, he has been a Professor at the Department of Systems and Control, National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC/MCTI), Petrópolis, Brazil, and served as the Head of Department and the Director of the Research Center for Control of Dynamic Systems (2000-2006). He has held long-term visiting positions at the Laboratoire d Automatique de Grenoble (France), the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (Brazil), and the University of Newcastle (Australia). He has also held short-term visiting positions at universities in several countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Israel, Singapore, and Switzerland. He was Associated Editor of the IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information and of the International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control (IJRNC), Guest Editor of the IJRNC Special Issue on H-infinity and Robust Filtering, and member of the Editorial Board of the IJRNC and the IEE Proceedings Control Theory Applications. He served as member of the Council of the Brazilian Space Agency (as the representative of the scientific community), Chairman of the IFAC Technical Committee on Linear Control Systems (2002-2005), and as a member of the IFAC Council for the term 2005-2008 (IFAC: International Federation of Automatic Control). Dr. de Souza is an IEEE Fellow (for outstanding contributions to robust control and filtering), an IFAC Fellow (for fundamental contributions to robust control and filtering, time-delay systems, and Riccati equations), a Fellow of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow 1A of the Brazilian National Research Council. He has been a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Control Systems Society for 2004-2008. His research interests include stability analysis, robust control, robust signal estimation, time-delay systems, 2-D systems, and Markov jump systems. He has published over 250 peer reviewed scientific papers (84 in international journals) and to date his journal papers have received 4584 citations in the Web of Science (under the names: de Souza CE; deSouza CE), with an h-index of 35, including 13 papers with more than 100 citations (see ISI ResearcherID No. A-6676-2009: ISI ResearcherID No. A-6676-2009). His citation count in Scopus is 6043 (with an h-index of 39) and 8939 in Google Scholar with an h-index of 46 (Google Scholar_de Souza CE). (updated on May 02, 2014) (Texto informado pelo autor)
