I have a background in Mathematics, from Universidade de Passo Fundo, Brazil (2004), and in Statistics and Quantitative Modelling from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil (2006). In 2008, I obtained a master degree in Production Engineering from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil. In 2014, I obtained a PhD degree in Industrial Engineering and Mangement from Universidade do Porto, Portugal. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Industrial Engineering and Mangement, at Universidade do Porto, Portugal. My research area involves the assessment of performance using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is a linear programming technique that measures the relative efficiency of a homogeneous set of decision-making units, in their use of multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. I am currently working on developing new efficiency and productivity measurement models, that can identify the drivers of good performance in companies, enhancing organizational performance and promoting robust benchmarking.
