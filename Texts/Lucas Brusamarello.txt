Lucas Brusamarello was born in Caxias do Sul, Brazil. He received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2005 and 2007, respectively. From 2001 to 2005, he worked with the Microelectronics Group at UFRGS (GME-UFRGS), developing stochastic algorithms and parallel algorithms for physical synthesis problems. In 2005 and 2006, as a Researcher in Post-Graduate Program on Computing (PPGC), he worked on yield analysis. From 2006 to 2008, he worked in the Computer-Aided Design Division, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA. In 2008 he joined the Post-Graduate Program on Microelectronics (PGMICRO) at UFRGS as a PhD student, working on impacts of transistors reliability issues at circuit level. Since 2009 he has been working with IMEC (Leuven, Belgium) as an international student on the same topics as his PhD. His research interests include yield analysis, design for yield, statistical modeling, numerical methods, physical synthesis, clock synthesis and reliability issues on nanometric devices.
