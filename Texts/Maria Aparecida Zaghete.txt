ZAGHETE, Maria Aparecida is a professor at UNESP-IQAr, Araraquara. She got the degree of Chemistry Technology in 1979 and received her M. Sc and Ph.D degrees in Science and Engineer of Material from São Carlos Federal University, Brazil in 1985 and 1993, respectively. She has been working in Electronic Ceramics as a researcher at the Chemistry Technology Department at UNESP-IQAr, Araraquara, Brazil. She also works as professor since 1980 at Chemistry Technology Department. Her principal interests include investigation of the ceramic powder preparation by soft chemistry and hydrothermal processes especially microstructure control by templates. Her work is currently focussing on development of electronic ceramics with ferroelectrics properties such as capacitor and ressonator ceramics . Additionally, during the last 5 years, she has published 30 reviewed articles in refereed journals and proceedings. Prof. Zaghete has as the principal interests the investigation of conditions of complexes oxides materials sintheses, studing the microestructure development. Her works is currently focussing on development of electronic ceramics with ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics properties such as capacitor and ressonators ceramics. (Texto informado pelo autor)
