Our research focuses on understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumourigenesis and translating this knowledge into more efficient approaches for epigenetic therapy. We use a truly multi-disciplinary approach to investigate what mechanisms are driving the cancer-specific epigenetic alterations and to translate this knowledge into more efficient epigenetic interventions. To achieve this goal, we combine traditional molecular and cellular biology techniques with functional genomics screening, Next Generation Sequencing and computational biology.
