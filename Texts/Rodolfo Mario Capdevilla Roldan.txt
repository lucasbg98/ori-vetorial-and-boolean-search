Bachelor in Physics from the "Atlantic University" (2010) and currently a Master Science student in Physics at the "Institute for theoretical Physics of the Sao Paulo State University" (2011-2013). He has experience in Physics, with emphasis on Physics of Elementary Particles and Fields. He also has experience teaching physics, working as a monitor of reinforcement in mathematics and physics (2010) and assistant in the physics laboratories at the "Atlantic University" (2009) and as Professor of Mechanical Physics at the Educational Foundation "Experimental Institute of Atlantic: José Celestino Mutis "(2010). His main research area is the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) specifically the problem of Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking and its relationship with confinement of Quarks and Gluons. The Monography to obtain the grade of Master in Physics is about this theme and it has the title (provisional) "Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking: The Fermionic Gap Equation and Confinement".
