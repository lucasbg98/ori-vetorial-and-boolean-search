The author has participated on a studying abroad exchange program at the University of Florida during the academic year of 2005/2006. Earned his Bachelor degree in Agronomy (2006) and Master of Science degree in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition from the Federal University of Viçosa (2008) and his Ph.D. in Environmental Soil Chemistry from the University of Delaware, USA (2012). The author has experience in soil fertility, soil management and conservation and soil chemistry, focusing his studies on the agronomic potential of agricultural residues, particularly, on the utlization of residues derived from animal production for crop production and their fate in the environment. His research is also committed to understanding the bonding configurations of phosphate on soil minerals, in particular as environmental conditions vary in time, pH and surface loading. Nowadays, Dr. Abdala serves as a researcher and Molecular Environmental Sciences program coordinator at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory. (Texto informado pelo autor)
