Paulo Boschcov (PB) was graduated in Biological Sciences, medical modality (1973), and obtained his master's (1976) and PhD (1981) degrees in Molecular Biology (Biophysics) at UNIFESP/EPM. | In the research area, he collaborated in several projects related to the biochemistry of biologically active peptides and enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system. PB also worked on synthesis and chromatographic purification of peptides. Regarding education, he taught classes to undergraduate students of the medical, biomedical, and nursing courses. | His postdoctoral studies were conducted at the Instituto de Medicina Tropical (SP, Sorologia, 1999-2000) and USP (ICB4/Dept of Immunology, 2001-2003). At USP, he collaborated on projects in the area of applied Immunology, with focus on oxidized LDL and atherosclerosis. There, he also taught graduate students the principles of analytical and preparative HPLC of peptides. | In the period 2009-2012, he also coordinated the activities of the Institutional Committee for Biological and Chemical Wastes at Unifesp, campus São Paulo (http://www.unifesp.br/reitoria/residuos). | In 2008, PB retired from Unifesp/EPM to be the managing editor of Bridge Textos Técnicos (http://bridgetextos.com.br).
