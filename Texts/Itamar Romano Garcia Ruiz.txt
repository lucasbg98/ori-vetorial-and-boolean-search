Dr. Itamar R. G. Ruiz is Graduate and Licensed in Biological Sciences (1969); MSc in Biological Sciences (Biology/Genetics) (1974); and PHD in Sciences (Biology/Genetics) (1980), all the titles having been obtained at the Biosciences Institute, from the University of Sao Paulo. She has done stages after her PHD at the Université Paris VII; at the Institut de Recherches Scientifiques sur le Cancer; and at the Institut Gustave-Roussy; all in France (1981-1984). She has been a Scientific Researcher (level VI) at the Genetics Laboratory, Butantan Institut since 1976, being recently retired (Mai 6, 2011). Professor at the Post-Graduate Program that joints Butantan Institut, Institut of Technological Research, and University of Sao Paulo. She has experience in Genetics, with emphasis on Cytogenetic; Molecular Evolution of Vertebrates; Molecular Genetics of Skin Cancers; and Effect of snake venom toxins on tumor cells growth, and metastasis. One research line has focused on the structure (whole sequencing) and methylation of ribosomal cistrons of Odontophrynus americanus 2n and 4n (polyploid Amphibians). Another line deals with the organization of genomic genes encoding bothropasin and jararhagin toxins from Bothrops jararaca (Viper). Finally, the current research lines deal with DNA structure (microsatellites and RAPD profiles; SNP of PTCH and CDKN2A genes); expression of oncogenes and suppressor genes in melanoma (biopsies and cell lines), and non-melanomas (BCC, SCC biopsies). The study aims at finding molecular markers associated with skin tumor genesis. (Texto informado pelo autor)
