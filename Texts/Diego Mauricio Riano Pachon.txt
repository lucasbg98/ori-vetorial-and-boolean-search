I have a bachelor in Biology from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2001), a Doctorate in Plant Molecular Biology from the Universitaet Potsdam (2008) and a Postdoc in Bioinformatics from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology (2010). For 2.5 years I was the leader of the research group "Computational and Evolutionary Biology" at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, while serving as Assistant Professor in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics (2010 2012). Since February 2013 I am a researcher at the Labóratorio Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia do Bioetanol part of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais, Campinas, Brazil, leading a group in Computational and Evolutionary Biology. My areas of expertise are biology, bioinformatics and computational and evolutionary biology. I am interested in the evolution of biological networks in general, and gene regulatory networks in particular; as well as in the evolution of gene families, molecular characterization of organisms, predicting the function of non-coding RNAs, genome annotation, machine learning, classi fication problems, identi fication and evolution of protein domains and the development of integrative databases for omics data. Recently, in my research group, we have been working mostly with data coming from Next Generation Sequencing technologies. We have dealt with 454 and Illumina data in order to reconstruct full genome sequences and call polymorphims from bacteria, green algae and fungi. We have also reconstructed complex transcriptomes from angiosperms and fungi, focused on plant-pathogen interactions in order to elucidate their molecular basis, and in developing molecular markers that could aid selection of resistant varieties or cultivars.
