The main research line is Leishmaniasis where develop studies in the endemic areas, mainly in the Amazon region, integrated with a well equipped Laboratory for pathological studies, including immunopathogical techniques as well as molecular biology, experimental models and epidemiological studies. The main interest is the comprehension of the pathogenetical mechanisms and regional characteristics of the diseases.. Recently we propose a clinical and immunopathological classification of the leishmaniasis, to both the cutaneous form and, latter to, the visceral form. All these studies are based on epidemiological and laboratory work. Others research lines are malaria, Chagas disease and emerging parasitoses.
