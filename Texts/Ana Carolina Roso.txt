Post-doc Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (2013-nowadays). Actually work at Genetic Departament studing root-specific promoters in tobbaco and soybean transgenic plants. Ph.D. Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (graduation, July 2013). Development part of PhD at University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, (visiting scholar in weed science from July 2012 April 2013). The PhD focused in weed science investigating the mechanism of resistance to ALS and PPO enzymes in Euphorbia heterophylla L. (wild poinsettia) with multiple herbicide resistance. The qualifications and skills summary are: Experience in field and greenhouse experiment such as herbicide dose-response bioassay; mortality, injury and growth rate reduction evaluations in crops and weeds; field lay-outing; weed management in rice and soybean; Additionally have knowledgeable in herbicide symptomology; Experience in physiological and molecular studies concerning herbicides; Experience in enzymatic assays to determine the herbicide resistance level; Training in absorption, translocation and metabolism of herbicides using radioactive compounds (C14) and Knowledge in statistical analysis software such as SAS, SISVAR, SigmaPlot and Microsoft Excel. Dissertation: Multiple herbicide resistance of Euphorbia heterophylla (L.) to ALS and PPO inhibitor. M.S. Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS (Porto Alegre/RS/Brazil) in 2009, acquiring experience in the use of genomic tools applied to the study of weeds, focusing on resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides . During the Masters developed SNPs molecular markers for the rapid diagnosis of resistance to imidazolinone herbicides on red rice. Thesis: Mechanism of resistance to imidazolinone herbicides in cultivated rice and in red rice. B.S. Agronomist at Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil. BS Agronomy, 2007.
