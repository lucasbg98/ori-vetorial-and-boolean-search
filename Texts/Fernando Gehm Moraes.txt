Fernando Moraes received the Electrical Engineering and M.Sc. degrees from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1987 and 1990, respectively. In 1994 he received the Ph.D. degree from the Laboratoire d´Informatique, Robotique et Microélectronique de Montpellier (LIRMM), France. The thesis (defended in 1994) received the distinction Très Honorable avec Félicitations du Jury. Another important award is the Best Conceptual Design in the DATE Conference, which is the Europe premier conference in microelectronics design automation. He is currently at PUCRS, where he has been an Associate Professor from 1996 to 2002, and Professor since 2002. From 1998 to 2000 he joined the LIRMM as an Invited Professor for 3 months each year. He has authored and co-authored 22 peer refereed journal articles in the field of VLSI design, comprising the development of networks on chip and telecommunication circuits. One of these articles, HERMES: an Infrastructure for Low Area Overhead Packet-switching Networks on Chip, is cited by more than 350 other papers. He has also authored and co-authored more than 180 conference papers on these topics. He has co-advised 3 MSc, advised 22 MsC, advised 4 PhD and co-advised 3 PhD works. Mr. Moraes is member of the program committee of the Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI), the Latin American Test Workshop (LATW), the IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI), Networks-on-Chip (NoCs), System-on-Chip Symposium (SoC). During the period 2001-2006 Mr. Moraes was responsible for the Computer Engineering Course at PUCRS (Brazil). From 2008-2010 he were responsible for the Computer Science Graduate Program at PUCRS. His primary research interests include Microelectronics, FPGAs, reconfigurable architectures, NoCs (networks on chip) and MPSoCs (multiprocessor system on chip). SBC, SBMICRO and IEEE Senior Member.
